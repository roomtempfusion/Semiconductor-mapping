In this concept, owing to the precise matching of positive and negative polarizations of both sides of GaN and AlGaN materials, average charge concentration in the material becomes nearly zero under reverse bias condition, which realizes extremely high breakdown voltage. This model is confirmed by device simulation taking all polarization charges of GaN-based materials into account. Furthermore, experimentally fabricated GaN-based Schottky barrier diodes showed a linear increase of breakdown voltage along the anode-cathode spacing, achieving a record breakdown voltage over 9000 V."

The analysis shows that the 2-D SMM is required to accurately account for the measured results. Using the 2-D SMM simulation, we find that there is almost no reflection at the interface from slot to waveguide while a large reflection exists at the interface from waveguide to slot, and the power loss is much larger than the power reflected. For a single slot, the slot width has little influence on the slot reflectivity, which coincides with the measured results. The reflection and transmission of the slot are found to be exponentially dependent on the slot depth"

Linear Platform Evaluation in Semiconductor Manufacturing,"['Kai-Ting Yang', 'Li-Jen Ko', 'Hsiang-Yin Shen']",IEEE Transactions on Semiconductor Manufacturing,2017,0,0,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8057281/,"{'Manufacturing Technology Center, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, Hsinchu, Taiwan'}",{'Taiwan'},"Equipment productivity in semiconductor manufacturing has become a major topic due to high equipment prices. It is easier and more precise to calculate productivity based on the running logs; however, engineers may often be assigned to estimate the productivity of the equipment in the design phase to predict project benefits so that investment decisions can be made. In such situations, no running log is available to calculate equipment productivity. If the architecture of the equipment and the wafer flow are simple, equipment productivity still can be evaluated using algebra-based solutions. Unfortunately, with rapidly shrinking IC dimensions equipment architecture becomes more and more complicated so a linear platform is typically used. In a linear platform, multiple mainframes are used to install more chambers. In each main-frame, there may be multiple robots to enable efficient wafer transmission. It is very difficult to estimate the productivity of a linear platform using simple algebra-based solutions; however, accurate productivity estimation of a linear platform is critical due to its higher price. To address this problem, a novel estimative methodology is proposed in this paper. This method analyzes the potential wait time of a chamber and then identifies the productivity bottleneck of the platform. The proposed methodology is designed for calculating wafers per hour for the linear platform. The accuracy of the proposed methodology is then verified by a simulation model. By applying this methodology to estimate the productivity for a semiconductor manufacturing line incorrect equipment investment can be reduced, therefore enhancing market competitiveness."

Therefore, the fundamental mode possesses larger optical confinement factor than those of the high-order modes, and reaches the lasing threshold more easily, which is demonstrated by the single-lobe horizontal far-field pattern of the TPC broad-area laser under an injection current of 0.3 A near the threshold.

This effect is believed to be more significant in green LEDs than in violet and blue LEDs."

Therefore, this article presents a comprehensive review of topside interconnection technologies of WBG semiconductor power devices and modules. First, the challenges and driving factors for the interconnection of WBG semiconductor dies are discussed. Second, for each widely commercially used WBG semiconductor, i.e., silicon carbide and gallium nitride, technical details and innovative features of state-of-the-art interconnection techniques in packages are reviewed. Then, the majority of existing topside interconnection materials for WBG semiconductors are categorized and compared, followed by a discussion of their advantages, challenges, and failure modes.

We explain this notion through a review of the types of solar cells based on an inversion layer, induced in the semiconductor absorber by a metal, by a dielectric material with fixed charges, or by another semiconductor. In these types, which include the metal-insulator-semiconductor (MIS), semiconductor-insulator-semiconductor, and MIS inversion layer solar cells, interfaces play a crucial role, even more so than in other forms of solid-state photovoltaics.

The indicator has been improved to detect only this problem, and to minimize the impact of false alarms that cause a loss of equipment productivity. The indicator can be readily extended to new chambers and the control limits are easily set for all recipes. This is because the equation for the indicator is very simple, and both the equation and the control limits are common to all sputtering chambers and recipes. It can therefore significantly reduce the setup work required of engineers, which is one of the biggest challenges in high-mix semiconductor manufacturing. The indicator is easily applied to newly installed tools at start of production and restrains the number of scrap wafers at minimum level. We also describe the mechanism of trace data changes in abnormal discharge modes using equivalent electrical circuits."

Analogously, adjusting the fuel or the oxidizer flow in fuel-fired abatement devices provides a higher flame temperature where thermal cracking of higher molecular weight low-k CVD organosilicon precursors can more readily occur, allowing the carbon-rich precursors to more completely oxidize."

Extraction of the Trench Sidewall Capacitances in an n-Type 4H-SiC Trench Metal– Oxide–Semiconductor Structure,"['Zhiyu Guo', 'Jingmin Wu', 'Run Tian', 'Fengxuan Wang', 'Pengfei Xu', 'Xiang Yang', 'Zhongchao Fan', 'Fuhua Yang', 'Zhi He']",IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices,2021,1,0,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9423878/,"{'Institute of Semiconductors, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China', 'School of Microelectronics, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China', 'Institute of Microelectronics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China'}",{'China'},"In this work, a method was investigated to extract trench sidewall and trench bottom capacitances of a SiC trench metal-oxide-semiconductor (MOS) structure. Five groups of 4H-SiC trench MOS capacitors were designed and fabricated, with various trench bottom widths and trench mesa widths. High-frequency capacitance-voltage (HFCV) measurements at 100 kHz were performed on these trench MOS structures. The relationships between trench MOS capacitances and the widths of trench bottom as well as trench mesa were studied. As expected, under the same bias voltage, the measured trench MOS capacitances were proportional to the trench bottom widths and trench mesa widths. Based on this, the contributions of capacitances from the bottom, mesa, and sidewall of trench in trench MOS structure were studied systematically. The oxide thicknesses at different locations in trench were extracted. The C-V characteristics of the MOS capacitors from trench sidewall and trench bottom could also be deduced, from which the flat-band voltage and the charges in oxide of these two MOS capacitors could be subsequently calculated and analyzed. This method provides a convenient and precise technology to monitor process control in SiC trench MOSFETs manufacturing."

This industrial laser source relies on a combination of technologies that have matured in recent years. In particular, effective means of stacking and imaging monolithic semiconductor laser arrays (a.k.a., bars), together with advances in the design and manufacture of the bars, have enabled the production of robust sources at market-competitive costs. Semiconductor lasers are presently the only lasers known that combine an efficiency of about 50% with compact size and high reliability. Currently the maximum demonstrated output power of a 10-mm-wide semiconductor laser bar exceeds the 260 W level when assembled on an actively cooled heat sink. (The rated power is in the range of 50-100 W). Power levels in the kilowatt range can be reached by stacking such devices. The requirements on the stacking technique and the optic assembly to achieve high brightness are discussed. Optics for beam collimation in fast and slow axis are compared. An example for an optical setup to use in materials processing will be shown. Spot sizes as low as 0.4 mm/spl times/1.2 mm at a numerical aperture of 0.3 and output power of 1 kW are demonstrated. This results in a power density of more than 200 kW/cm/sup 2/. A setup for further increase in brightness by wavelength and polarization coupling will be outlined. For incoherent coupling of multiple beams into a single core optical fiber, a sophisticated beam shaping device is needed to homogenize the beam quality of stacked semiconductor lasers.

Semiconductor Manufacturing Process Monitoring Using Gaussian Mixture Model and Bayesian Method With Local and Nonlocal Information,['Jianbo Yu'],IEEE Transactions on Semiconductor Manufacturing,2012,34,0,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6177680/,"{'School of Mechatronic Engineering and Automation, Shanghai University, Shanghai, China'}",{'China'},"Fault detection has been recognized in the semiconductor industry as an effective component of advanced process control framework in increasing yield and product quality. Principal component analysis (PCA) has been applied widely to semiconductor manufacturing process monitoring. However, the unique characteristics of semiconductor processes - high dimension of data, nonlinearity in most batch processes, and multimodal batch trajectories due to multiple operating conditions - significantly limit applicability of PCA to semiconductor manufacturing. This paper proposes a manifold learning algorithm, local and nonlocal preserving projection (LNPP), for feature extraction. Different from PCA, which aims to discover the global structure of Euclidean space, LNPP can find a good linear embedding that preserves local and nonlocal information. This may enable LNPP to find meaningful low-dimensional information hidden in high-dimensional observations. The Gaussian mixture model (GMM) is applied to handle process data with nonlinearity or multimodal features. GMM-based Mahalanobis distance is proposed to assess process states, and a Bayesian inference-based method is proposed to provide the process failure probability. A variable replacing-based contribution analysis method is developed to identify the process variables that are responsible for the onset of process fault. The proposed monitoring model is demonstrated through its application to a batch semiconductor etch process."

Rectification of microwave currents and intervalley electromotive force are discussed to be mainly responsible for high responsivity and its rapid decrease within microwave range.

Deactivation Induced Within Wafer Nonuniformity During Nonmelt Laser Annealing of Arsenic and Phosphorus Implanted Silicon,"['Chyiu Hyia Poon', 'Alex See', 'Meisheng Zhou', 'Chee Wah Wong']",IEEE Transactions on Semiconductor Manufacturing,2009,5,0,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4773487/,"{'Technology Development Department, Chartered Semiconductor Manufacturing Private Limited, Singapore', 'Fab Operations, Chartered Semiconductor Manufacturing Private Limited, Singapore'}",{'Singapore'},"In the setup for nonmelt laser spike anneal (LSA), the wafer is mounted with the front-side facing the laser beam and backside facing the heated hotplate. When arsenic or phosphorus-implanted silicon is subjected to LSA, sheet resistance degradation, indicative of dopant deactivation, is observed when the post-LSA thermal budget provided by the heated chuck (hotplate) is increased. This additional thermal budget is associated with the chuck temperature and duration a wafer is left on the chuck after LSA. The deactivation is believed to occur due to the ineffective removal of implantation damage by LSA, giving rise to the release of point defects during the post-LSA thermal cycle that aids inactive clusters formation. The observed phenomena severely degrades the within wafer uniformity since LSA is a localized heating process that relies on scanning the laser beam across the whole wafer. As such, different portions of the implanted silicon wafer will remain on the hotplate for varying durations depending on when the laser beam scans through a particular spot. By adopting a dual step source/drain anneal scheme that incorporates a spike rapid thermal annealing condition sufficient to anneal out the implantation damage prior to LSA, the within wafer nonuniformity issue can be rectified."

The principal motivation for this paper is that a shallow-structured RGRN performs well on single-pattern defects, achieving an accuracy of 99.8%, but performs poorly when a wafer has mixed-defect patterns. The proposed approach improves RGRN performance, particularly on mixed-pattern defects, by incorporating a novel information gain (IG)-based splitter as well as deep-structured ML. A spatial filter is applied to remove random noise and reduce model bias during training. During the first detection stage, the splitter generates unique rules that are built using the IG theory and splits the defects data into single-defect and mixed-defect patterns. Single-defect patterns are then classified by RGRN, whereas mixed-defect patterns are fed into the deep-structured ML model for further classification. This combination improves the ability of the proposed approach to classify diverse defect patterns and achieve a better overall performance. Our experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves an overall detection accuracy of 86.17% on a dataset that contains real data representing both single-defect and mixed-defect patterns, as commonly found in real manufacturing scenarios, outperforming existing ML-based models."

Vertically etched III-V semiconductor devices typically require sidewall passivation to suppress leakage currents and planarization of the passivation material for metal interconnection and device integration. It is, however, challenging to planarize all devices at once. This technique offers wafer-scale passivation and planarization that is automatically leveled to the device top in the 1-3-/spl mu/m vicinity surrounding each device. In this method, a dielectric hard mask is used to define the device area. An undercut structure is intentionally created below the hard mask, which is retained during the subsequent polymer spinning and anisotropic polymer etch back. The spin-on polymer that fills in the undercut seals the sidewalls for all the devices across the wafer. After the polymer etch back, the dielectric mask is removed leaving the polymer surrounding each device level with its device top to atomic scale flatness. This integration method is robust and is insensitive to spin-on polymer thickness, polymer etch nonuniformity, and device height difference. It prevents the polymer under the hard mask from etch-induced damage and creates a polymer-free device surface for metallization upon removal of the dielectric mask. We applied this integration technique in fabricating an InP-based photonic switch that consists of a mesa photodiode and a quantum-well waveguide modulator using benzocyclobutene (BCB) polymer. We demonstrated functional integrated photonic switches with high process yield of >90%, high breakdown voltage of >25 V, and low ohmic contact resistance of /spl sim/10 /spl Omega/.

Four devices with different shapes and widths of ridge elements are fabricated. The trapezoid ridges reduce the optical losses at regions between ridge elements in the trapezoid devices, thus enhances the optical coupling between ridge elements and lead to larger coherent output powers compared with the rectangular ones. Meanwhile, narrower ridges with the same shape give a stronger optical confinement to the lateral modes in every single ridge and improve the overall modal and far-field characteristics of the device. The results show that the trapezoid and narrower ridges can lead to a comprehensive improvement in the performances of the coupled ridge waveguide laser arrays emitting at 2.1~\mu \text{m} ."

Increasing the injection current will also decrease the response times."

For accumulation-mode VDMOS, the drift region is lightly doped to support drain voltage in the OFF-state. A large density of electrons is accumulated to modulate the conductivity of the drift region in the ON-state. It is contradictory to obtain high breakdown voltage (BV) and low specific ON-resistance (R ON,sp ) in the conventional VDMOS, because both of them depend on the doping concentration of the drift region. This contradictory relationship between the BV and R ON,sp is eliminated for EA and GA VDMOS, thereby breaking the superjunction (SJ) silicon limit. Simulation results indicate that R ON,sp of the accumulation-mode VDMOS devices are significantly reduced. The RON,sp of EA and GA VDMOS can be reduced by 60% (0.85 mQ · cm 2 ) and 30% (1.68 mQ · cm 2 ) compared with the SJ VDMOS (2.41 mQ · cm 2 ) at the BV of 600 V, respectively.

We find that increasing the acceptor concentration increases the unsaturated optical gain but at the same time decreases the saturation density and the effective relaxation lifetime. Also our calculation reveals that the use of p-type doping will be associated with an increase in the transparency current where the increase in the transparency current depends on the incident photon energy.

Use of SMIT has several advantages, notably lower manufacturing cost and shorter process time than in the case of conventional processing, because no photolithography process (including deposition and stripping of resist) is required. We have already demonstrated an application of SMIT to transistor fabrication, using various implanted dose conditions for the same wafer. Threshold voltage values can be controlled as effectively by implanted doses as they can by conventional implantation, and the dose dependence of the threshold voltage could be obtained from one wafer to which various implantation conditions are applied. Using SMIT, implantation conditions can be changed chip by chip without additional processes. This flexibility of implantation conditions is another advantage of SMIT.

Fault Detection Using Principal Components-Based Gaussian Mixture Model for Semiconductor Manufacturing Processes,['Jianbo Yu'],IEEE Transactions on Semiconductor Manufacturing,2011,89,0,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5766763/,"{'Department of Mechanical Automation Engineering, Shanghai University, Shanghai, China'}",{'China'},"Fault detection has been recognized in the semiconductor industry as an effective component of advanced process control framework in increasing yield and product quality. Recently, conventional process monitoring-based principal component analysis (PCA) has been applied to semiconductor manufacturing by quickly detecting when the process abnormalities have occurred. However, the unique characteristics of the semiconductor processes, nonlinearity in most batch processes, multimodal batch trajectories due to multiple operating conditions, significantly limit the applicability of PCA to the fault detection of semiconductor manufacturing. To explicitly address these unique issues in semiconductor processes, a principal components (PCs)-based Gaussian mixture model (GMM) (named PCGMM) has been proposed in this paper. GMM is capable to handle complicated data with nonlinearity or multimodal features by a mixture of multiple Gaussian components, which is very suitable to describe observations from semiconductor processes. Furthermore, two quantification indexes (negative Log likelihood probability and Mahalanobis distance) are proposed for assessing process states, and a Bayesian inference-based calculation method is further used to provide the process failure probability. The validity and effectiveness of PCGMM-based fault detection model are illustrated through two simulation processes and a semiconductor manufacturing process. The experimental results demonstrated that the proposed model is superior to PCA-based monitoring models and can achieve accurate and early detection of various types of faults in complicated manufacturing processes."

The test samples are unpassivated Schottky-gate HEMTs and metal-insulator-semiconductor HEMTs (MIS-HEMTs) with SiN gate dielectric. For HEMTs, the dominant charge trapping sources are the surface trap states, whereas, for MIS-HEMTs, they are trap states in the SiN gate dielectric and GaN buffer. When these devices are shined with the UV light, the drain current increases apparently in both samples owing to the generated photocurrent. By combining the UV illumination and pulsed I-V measurement, we find out the UV light has less effect on the surface charge trapping in the unpassivated HEMTs. Moreover, in MIS-HEMTs, we observe the charge trapping in the SiN gate dielectric becomes more serious under UV illumination, whereas the charge trapping in the GaN buffer is suppressed significantly. These findings are important for designing a GaN-based HEMT for photonic applications. In addition, the different responses of the surface-, buffer-, and gate-dielectric-related charge trapping to the UV light suggest that it would be easier to distinguish the trap types by introducing the UV illumination during the pulse measurement."

Therefore, the order of processes should be considered when building a model that searches for the causes of low yield. However, there have been few studies in this area. This paper proposes a low-yield root cause search method considering the order of processes using a long short-term memory with attention mechanism (LSTM-AM) model.

Hence, an unfolded laser has theoretically lower power penalties induced by linear and nonlinear effects. For a 5.7-mm long laser cavity with 100-μm wide aperture, the experimental results demonstrate 21-W output from standard cavity whereas the unfolded cavity design achieves 33-W at 920 nm, which is >55% enhancement of the output, confirming the prediction of the theoretical calculations.

However, the CTs of wafer lots are difficult to forecast since they are influent by a lot factors (e.g., workload for every machine). The identification of key factors (called CT-related) can not only improve the prediction performance but also facilitate the control of CT, which is of particular significance. This paper focuses on gathering subtle variables into the candidate variables set along with the further analysis which is required in the correlation analysis between various candidate factors and CTs of wafer lots. The candidates set is first constructed to collect all factors that may affect wafer lots' CT. Then, a regression-based model is proposed to select CT-related variables, which consists of three parts: 1) discretization; 2) adaptive logistic regression-based correlation analysis; and 3) CT-related factor selection. Subsequently, a parallel computation model is implemented to forecast the CTs of wafer lots. In the numerical experiments, 108 CT-related factors stood out from 774 candidates and replaced six global factors (used as reference) to predict CTs of wafer lots. The results indicated that the proposed approach had higher accuracy than linear regression and back propagation network in CT forecasting in large scale data analysis."

The noise transfer model is used to determine the output noise power of a delay interference wavelength converter. An analytical expression is obtained for the nonlinear phase change in the SOA, which determines the output power of the wavelength-converted signal. These results show that the noise transfer in the wavelength conversion can be suppressed by increasing the probe signal power, but that the improvement in the output signal OSNR relative to the input signal OSNR is accompanied by a reduction in the conversion efficiency. This fundamental tradeoff can be readily investigated during the design optimization process using the concise results derived in this paper."

To study the effect of high temperature annealing on the properties of HPSI 4H-SiC, vertical-type photoconductive semiconductor switches were fabricated on two types of substrates, where one was non-annealed (nPCSS) and the other was annealed at 1500°C for 15 min (aPCSS).

The high temperature annealing reduced the Z 1/2 defect concentration in the aPCSS, which led to fewer photo-generated carriers in the aPCSS compared with nPCSS. The optoelectronic properties of the aPCSS exhibited much stronger dependence on the excitation optical energy and bias voltage than those of the nPCSS.

However, correct interpretation of the laterally diffused MOSFET (LDMOS) reverse recovery is challenging and requires special attention. This is due to the fact that the stored charges in the LDMOS drift region can flow from two different directions with each having different lifetime values. By studying the effects of diode reverse bias and gate voltage on the current flow direction during the reverse recovery, we present a simple approach to extract meaningful lifetime values, which can be used to determine material quality at different locations in the drift region of the LDMOS devices."

While calculating the scattering time and the mobility of the majority and minority-spin carriers, we took into account both the effects of thermal spin fluctuations and of the spatial disorder of magnetic atoms. These effects are responsible for the magnetic-field dependence of electrical resistivity. Namely, the application of the external magnetic field suppresses the thermodynamic spin fluctuations, thus promoting negative magnetoresistance (MR). Simultaneously, scattering by built-in spatial fluctuations of the atomic spins increases with the magnetic field. The latter effect is due to the growth of the magnitude of random local Zeeman splittings with the magnetic field. It promotes positive MR. We discuss the role of the above effects on MR of semiconductors where magnetic impurities are isoelectronic"

There exists three variation sources: 1) lot-to-lot variation; 2) wafer-to-wafer variation; and 3) site-to-site variation, which means the measurements cannot be considered independently. However, most existing control charts for monitoring wafer quality are based on the assumption that data are independently and identically distributed. To deal with the variations, we propose a mixed-effects model incorporating a Gaussian process to account for the variations. Based on the model, two control charts are implemented to detect anomalies of the measurements which can monitor the changes of the variations and the quality of products, respectively. Simulation studies and results from real applications show that this model and control scheme is effective in estimating and monitoring the variation sources in the manufacturing process."

We show here that the Pt-AlInAs reaction is not only controlled by the annealing time and temperature-the annealing ambient and the thermal ramp rate also affect the diffusion of Pt through the underlying semiconductor layers and impact the DC and RF device performance. Following the gate metal deposition, one process split was rapid thermal annealed at 250 °C and subsequently passivated by atomic layer deposition (ALD) at 180 °C. For the second process split, the Pt gate sink-in process was carried out in the ALD system at 250 °C simultaneously with the gate passivation. Despite identical gate sink-in temperatures, the two process splits exhibit different characteristics suggesting different gate-to-channel distances. The distance of the Pt gate to the GaInAs channel was therefore confirmed through high-resolution cross-sectional scanning transmission electron microscopy analysis. The results presented here reveal that both the suitable ramp rate and the sink-in ambient are necessary to achieve a fully sunken Pt gate."

In electro-transport measurements, the temperature dependence of resistivity revealed a noticeable semiconducting behaviors and showed a conduction via variable range hopping (VRH) at low temperature. From XPS results, we assume that the origin of ferromagnetism in samples may be due to the breaking of superexchange antiferromagnetic correlations between Mn spin moments arising from Tellurium vacancies."

In addition, with the expected increase in water consumption, there is an incentive to find better ways to treat and recycle wastewaters. The possibility of using biological organisms to treat copper and organic-containing wastewater is studied. Two different approaches are combined to create a treatment strategy: adsorption on immobilized cells to treat copper and biodegradation by immobilized cells to treat organics [specifically isopropyl alcohol (IPA)].

The reflector of the devices has the same multi-quantum wells (MQWs) as the DFB section, which simplifies the device fabrication greatly, helping to lower the device cost. For the DBR integrated DFB lasers, experimental results show that a larger modulation current efficiency can be obtained when the DFB wavelength is more positively detuned relative to the reflection peak of the DBR reflector.

We define waiting time as the elapsed time between completing the previous operation and starting the next one. In addition to well-established features, we introduce novel features to capture the complexity of the manufacturing environment. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to attempt waiting time estimation in a high product-mix / low-volume semiconductor fab. We present a framework for feature selection which is composed of three steps: First, random forest models are trained for each operation. Second, a permutation feature importance (PFI) for the full set of features for each operation is computed and the performance is statistically evaluated. The optimal subset of features is then chosen by a sequential backward search based on the PFI values. Third, the performance in terms of the coefficient of determination of each optimized model is evaluated by means of the initial performance. We apply the framework to real operational data from the production areas Lithography and Diffusion and conclude that the feature set can be reduced significantly, while the prediction performance remains equal. The novel features are found to be frequently used when estimating waiting times in the investigated use case."

Here, the authors present an algorithm for generating structurally aligned grids including anisotropy with resolutions varying over several orders of magnitude. The algorithm is based on a level set approach and permits to define the refined resolutions in a flexible manner as a function of doping. Furthermore, criteria on grid quality can be enforced. In order to show the practicability of this method, the authors study the examples of a trench gate metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistor (TMOSFET) and a radio frequency silicon-on-insulator lateral double diffused metal-oxide-semiconductor (RF SOI LDMOS) power device using the device simulator MINIMOS NT, where simulations are performed on a grid generated by the new algorithm. In order to resolve the interesting regions of the TMOSFET and the RF SOI LDMOS power device accurately, several regions of refinement were defined where the grid was grown with varying resolutions."

Furthermore, with increasing of test voltage, the discharge passed to the glow mode that contains the formation of unstable current oscillations. When the obtained data were evaluated, it was concluded that medium pressure had a significant effect on the development of SBD at fixed electrode gap.

From 25 to 300 °C, the safety limit of positive V gs of SiC MOSFETs is mainly dependent on the gate oxide on the JFET surface, whereas that of negative V gs is dependent on the gate oxide on the channel surface. The gate oxide on the channel surface is weaker than that on the JFET surface in terms of Fowler–Nordheim (F-N) tunneling, resulting in asymmetric safety V gs of current SiC MOSFET. Moreover, when temperature ranges from 25 to 150 °C, the degradation of gate oxide under −15 V <  V gs  < 25 V is caused by the hole or electron direct tunneling mechanism. However, when the temperature reaches 300 °C, the degradation of gate oxide under −5 V <  V gs  < 10 V is caused by the hole or electron hopping conduction mechanism. Furthermore, the reliability of gate oxide is evaluated by the time-dependent dielectric breakdown measurement. The charge-to-breakdown ( Q BD ) of gate oxide is severely degraded at 300 °C mainly due to the barrier height ( ${\it{ \Phi}}_{\rm B}$ ) degradation. These efforts can provide accurate weakness points of gate oxide under higher V gs bias (particular for negative bias) and higher temperature (300 °C) for SiC MOSFETs, further helping use and design rugged converters with the fast-speed operation of SiC MOSFETs."

Suppression of Dark Current on AlGaN/GaN Metal–Semiconductor–Metal Photodetectors,"['Han-Yin Liu', 'Yi-Hsuan Wang', 'Wei-Chou Hsu']",IEEE Sensors Journal,2015,14,0,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7115014/,"{'Department of Electronic Engineering, Feng Chia University, Taichung, Taiwan', 'Advanced Optoelectronic Technology Center, Department of Electrical Engineering, Institute of Microelectronics, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan'}",{'Taiwan'},"This paper proposes the H 2 O 2 oxidation technique to grow Al 2 O 3 as the surface passivation layer of the metal-semiconductor-metal ultraviolet (UV) photodetector (PD). The dark current of the H 2 O 2 -grown-Al 2 O 3 -passivated PD was reduced from 104 to 4.43 nA. The surface leakage of the PD was reduced from 65.7 nA/1.67 μA to 0.46 nA/0.5 nA in the dark/under illumination. It was found that ~35% photocurrent results from the surface leakage. The surface leakages in the H 2 O 2 -grown-Al 2 O 3 passivated and the plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD)-grown-SiO 2 passivated PDs were reduced significantly. Although the photocurrent and the photoresponsivity of the oxide-passivated PDs were lower than those of the unpassivated one, the dark current, UV-to-visible rejection ratio, noise equivalent power, and the detectivity of the oxide-passivated PDs were better than those of the unpassivated one. In addition, the performances of the H 2 O 2 -grown-Al 2 O 3 passivated PD were better than those of the PECVD-grown-SiO 2 passivated one."
BV > 3 kV/VTH = 3.5 V Normally-Off Al0.6Ga0.4N MOSFET With Recessed-Gate and Ferroelectric Gate Dielectric,"['Jieying Wang', 'Hong Zhou', 'Sami Alghamdi', 'Jincheng Zhang', 'Xuefeng Zheng', 'Yue Hao']",IEEE Electron Device Letters,2022,1,0,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9927428/,"{'Key Laboratory of Wide Band Gap Semiconductor Materials and Devices, School of Microelectronics, Xidian University, Xi’an, China', 'Electrical and Computer Engineering Department, Faculty of Engineering, King Abdulaziz University, Jeddah, Saudi Arabia'}","{'Saudi Arabia', 'China'}","This letter reports on the demonstration of recessed-gate ultra-wide bandgap semiconductor Al0.6Ga0.4N MOSFET with Hf0.5Zr0.5O2 (HZO) ferroelectric charge storage dielectric structure. A positive threshold voltage ( \text{V}_{\text {TH}} ) of 3.550 V and maximum gate swing of 15 V is achieved due to the trapped electrons induced by remnant polarization of HZO in gate stack. The Al0.6Ga0.4N MOSFET exhibits a specific on-resistance ( \text{R}_{\text {on,sp}} ) of {17.8} \text {m}~\Omega \cdot \text {cm}^{{2}} . Moreover, an 840 V breakdown voltage (BV) is obtained with a gate-to-drain ( \text{L}_{\text {gd}} ) length of 2 ~\mu \text{m} , indicating an average breakdown electric field ( \text{E}_{\text {av}} ) beyond 4 MV/cm. In addition to the high \text{E}_{\text {av}} , a high BV > 3 kV is also derived on a transistor with \text {L}_{\text {gd}} = {8}\,\,\mu \text {m} , translating to a power figure-of-merit (P-FOM=BV2/ \text{R}_{\text {on,sp}} ) of 208 MW/cm2. These high device performances indicate a great potential of Al-rich E-mode AlGaN MOSFET for future high-power applications."
Application of Generalized Linear Models to Predict Semiconductor Yield Using Defect Metrology Data,"['Dana C. Krueger', 'Douglas C. Montgomery', 'Christina M. Mastrangelo']",IEEE Transactions on Semiconductor Manufacturing,2011,14,1,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5613203/,"{'Department of Industrial Engineering, Arizona State University, Tempe, AZ, USA', 'Department of Industrial Engineering, University of Washington, Seattle, WA, USA', 'Department of Management, Kansas State University, Manhattan, KS, USA'}",{'United States'},"Semiconductor yield modeling is essential to identify processing issues, improve quality, and meet customer demand. However, the massive amounts of data collected during the fabrication process and the number of historical models available make yield modeling a complex and challenging task. This paper presents a methodology to guide the practitioner in determining what data should be collected, integrated, and aggregated, followed by a modeling strategy to forecast yield using generalized linear models based on defect metrology data. This technique yields results at both the die and the wafer levels, significantly outperforms existing models found in the literature based on prediction errors, and identifies significant factors that can drive process improvement. This method also allows the nested structure of the process to be considered in the model, improving predictive capabilities and violating fewer assumptions. An example is presented to discuss this approach and to demonstrate the advantages of these models over the models of the past."
Performance-Improved Vertical Ni/SiO₂/4H-SiC Metal–Oxide–Semiconductor Capacitors for High-Resolution Radiation Detection,"['Omerfaruk Karadavut', 'Sandeep K. Chaudhuri', 'Joshua W. Kleppinger', 'Ritwik Nag', 'Krishna C. Mandal']",IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science,2022,3,0,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9759383/,"{'Department of Electrical Engineering, University of South Carolina (UofSC), Columbia, SC, USA'}",{'United States'},"We report the fabrication of vertical metal–oxide–semiconductor (MOS) detectors with the highest energy resolution ever reported. The MOS detectors have been fabricated on 50- $\mu \text{m}$ -thick n-type 4H-SiC epitaxial layers by growing a silicon dioxide (SiO 2 ) layer thermally prior to contact deposition. The MOS detectors exhibited leakage currents two orders of magnitude lower than that observed in a Schottky barrier detector (SBD) fabricated on similar 4H-SiC epilayers. The MOS detectors exhibited a much higher energy resolution of 0.4% compared to 0.8% observed in an SBD for 5486-keV alpha particles although both the devices showed a high charge collection efficiency (CCE) of 96% when exposed to the alpha particles. Capacitance mode deep-level transient spectroscopy (C-DLTS) revealed the presence of “lifetime killer” $\text{Z}_{\mathrm {1/2}}$ defects in similar concentrations in both the devices, and however, the corresponding capture cross section in the SBD has been observed to be one order of magnitude higher compared to the MOS detector, and instead of EH 6/7 center seen in the SBD, the MOS device showed the presence of EH 5 center. The higher resolution of the MOS device is attributed to the lower leakage current and difference in defect configurations observed between the two devices. The MOS detector showed a positive polarity C-DLTS peak with an activation energy of 1.22 eV, which is likely due to the nonnegligible impedance of the back contact because of the SiO 2 layer. The present study opens the great potential of other wide bandgap semiconductor-based vertical MOS detectors, which can be fully depleted for high-resolution X-/ $\gamma $ -ray detection."
Novel Power MOSFET With Partial SiC/Si Heterojunction to Improve Breakdown Voltage by Breakdown Point Transfer (BPT) Terminal Technology,"['Xiameng Wang', 'Baoxing Duan', 'Xin Yang', 'Yintang Yang']",IEEE Journal of the Electron Devices Society,2020,3,0,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9099313/,"{'Key Laboratory of the Ministry of Education for Wide Band-Gap Semiconductor Materials and Devices, School of Microelectronics, Xidian University, Xi’an, China'}",{'China'},"In this paper, a new vertical double-diffused metal-oxide semiconductor field effect transistors (VDMOS) is proposed with the partial SiC/Si heterojunction (Partial SiC/Si VDMOS) under the drain electrode in this paper for the first time. The breakdown point transfer technique (BPT) is used to transfer the breakdown point from the radius of curvature is large to the radius of curvature is small in the interface between Pwell and Ndrift region, which causes the longitudinal peak value of electric field to be raised, and the higher breakdown voltage (BV) can be obtained. At the same time, the formation of highly doped N-type silicon trench alleviates interface state problems caused by current flowing through SiC/Si heterojunction and further optimized the whole SiC/Si heterojunction (SiC/Si VDMOS). The limit line of the silicon has been broken because the result is improved between the BV and the specific on-resistance (R on,sp ). Compared with the conventional Si VDMOS, the BV is increased from 238V to 342V, and the R on,sp is reduced from 14.24mΩ·cm 2 to 13.92mΩ·cm 2 ."
