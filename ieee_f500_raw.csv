In this concept, owing to the precise matching of positive and negative polarizations of both sides of GaN and AlGaN materials, average charge concentration in the material becomes nearly zero under reverse bias condition, which realizes extremely high breakdown voltage. This model is confirmed by device simulation taking all polarization charges of GaN-based materials into account. Furthermore, experimentally fabricated GaN-based Schottky barrier diodes showed a linear increase of breakdown voltage along the anode-cathode spacing, achieving a record breakdown voltage over 9000 V."

Fortunately, these wafer defects leave unique patterns due to their spatial dependence across wafer maps. It is thus possible to identify and predict them in order to find the point of failure in the manufacturing process accurately. This paper introduces a novel simplified subspaced regression framework for the accurate and efficient identification of defect patterns in semiconductor wafer maps. It can achieve a test error comparable to or better than the state-of-the-art machine-learning (ML)-based methods, while maintaining a low computational cost when dealing with large-scale wafer data. The effectiveness and utility of the proposed approach has been demonstrated by our experiments on real wafer defect datasets, achieving detection accuracy of 99.884% and R 2 of 99.905%, which are far better than those of any existing methods reported in the literature."

It is easier and more precise to calculate productivity based on the running logs; however, engineers may often be assigned to estimate the productivity of the equipment in the design phase to predict project benefits so that investment decisions can be made. In such situations, no running log is available to calculate equipment productivity. If the architecture of the equipment and the wafer flow are simple, equipment productivity still can be evaluated using algebra-based solutions. Unfortunately, with rapidly shrinking IC dimensions equipment architecture becomes more and more complicated so a linear platform is typically used. In a linear platform, multiple mainframes are used to install more chambers. In each main-frame, there may be multiple robots to enable efficient wafer transmission. It is very difficult to estimate the productivity of a linear platform using simple algebra-based solutions; however, accurate productivity estimation of a linear platform is critical due to its higher price. To address this problem, a novel estimative methodology is proposed in this paper. This method analyzes the potential wait time of a chamber and then identifies the productivity bottleneck of the platform. The proposed methodology is designed for calculating wafers per hour for the linear platform. The accuracy of the proposed methodology is then verified by a simulation model. By applying this methodology to estimate the productivity for a semiconductor manufacturing line incorrect equipment investment can be reduced, therefore enhancing market competitiveness."

The indicator has been improved to detect only this problem, and to minimize the impact of false alarms that cause a loss of equipment productivity. The indicator can be readily extended to new chambers and the control limits are easily set for all recipes. This is because the equation for the indicator is very simple, and both the equation and the control limits are common to all sputtering chambers and recipes. It can therefore significantly reduce the setup work required of engineers, which is one of the biggest challenges in high-mix semiconductor manufacturing.

With a two-phase growth of different V/III ratio at a relatively low growth temperature of 1250 °C, up to a 7.3-μm-thick high-quality crack-free AlN film with a threading dislocation density of 8 × 10 8 cm -2 was obtained. Compared with the 0.9-μm AlN film grown on a planar sapphire substrate, the ELOG-AlN film has a lower dislocation density and a much better strain state, regardless of its 7.3-μm thickness. Compared with the single low V/III ratio growth, the two-phase growth method can lead to a coherent coalescence at the second growth stage and hence suppress new dislocations generating at the coalescence fronts. Stimulated emission was observed from Al(Ga)N multi-quantum-wells laser grown on the ELOG-AlN template with low dislocation density. The deep-ultraviolet laser (DUV) on these templates exhibited lasing at 263.3 nm with the spectral linewidth of 1.29 nm and threshold pumping power density of 2.7 MW/cm 2 at room temperature."

This method distinguishes itself by dynamically integrating the EM domain into the circuit-type electrothermal coupling analysis, thus enabling the multi-dimensional simulation that spans in time from nanoseconds to seconds, and in space from chip level to system level. In particular, it contains a parametric-extracted electrothermal model of the IGBT chip and a comprehensive 0-D thermal network as well as an EM network extracted from the 3-D module packaging structure for each paralleling chip. The incorporation of the EM, as well as thermal networks representing the 3-D packaging structure, reveals essential information about the current imbalance, power dissipation imbalance, and thermal imbalance inside the IGBT module with paralleling chips, which have a strong influence on the module reliability. To demonstrate the application of this approach, an unfavorably designed 1700-V/450-A half-bridge IGBT power module is evaluated in the simulation circuit, with experimentally verified electrothermal IGBT chip model and thermal as well as EM networks. The results have shown that the EM-electrothermal analysis can successfully reveal the dynamic interaction among different physical domains and, thus, the current as well as temperature imbalance among the paralleling chips inside the power module. The predicted current imbalance also agrees with that from the experimental test."

Oxygen or water vapor introduced upstream of plasma abatement devices reduces PFC reformation by preferentially combining with carbon and fluorine-containing radicals to form thermodynamically favorable byproducts that are non- or low-global warming. Introducing oxygen to low-k chemical vapor deposition (CVD) chamber clean processes also reduces PFC emissions, primarily by reducing CF/sub 4/ by forming thermodynamically stable CO and CO/sub 2/.

Different from PCA, which aims to discover the global structure of Euclidean space, LNPP can find a good linear embedding that preserves local and nonlocal information.

When arsenic or phosphorus-implanted silicon is subjected to LSA, sheet resistance degradation, indicative of dopant deactivation, is observed when the post-LSA thermal budget provided by the heated chuck (hotplate) is increased. This additional thermal budget is associated with the chuck temperature and duration a wafer is left on the chuck after LSA. The deactivation is believed to occur due to the ineffective removal of implantation damage by LSA, giving rise to the release of point defects during the post-LSA thermal cycle that aids inactive clusters formation. The observed phenomena severely degrades the within wafer uniformity since LSA is a localized heating process that relies on scanning the laser beam across the whole wafer. As such, different portions of the implanted silicon wafer will remain on the hotplate for varying durations depending on when the laser beam scans through a particular spot. By adopting a dual step source/drain anneal scheme that incorporates a spike rapid thermal annealing condition sufficient to anneal out the implantation damage prior to LSA, the within wafer nonuniformity issue can be rectified."

The noise figure (NF) is found to decrease, strongly depending on the relative injection direction of signal and pump (i.e., copropagating or counterpropagating beams). In the copropagating scheme, an improvement in NF is obtained, ranging from 2.5 dB in the low current regime (40 mA, 13-dB chip gain) to 0.5 dB at high currents (150 mA, 23-dB chip gain). In the counterpropagating scheme, NF improvement is less pronounced. We explain the effect by an advantageous carrier redistribution along the SOA under the presence of the pump beam at transparency.

Typically, wafer defects form spatial patterns that provide useful information, helping to identify problems and faults during the fabrication process. Machine learning (ML) methods have been used to classify these defects in order to locate the root causes of failure. This paper proposes a novel deep-structured ML approach as an extension of our previous randomized general regression network (RGRN) model, to identify and classify both single-defect and mixed-defect patterns. The principal motivation for this paper is that a shallow-structured RGRN performs well on single-pattern defects, achieving an accuracy of 99.8%, but performs poorly when a wafer has mixed-defect patterns. The proposed approach improves RGRN performance, particularly on mixed-pattern defects, by incorporating a novel information gain (IG)-based splitter as well as deep-structured ML. A spatial filter is applied to remove random noise and reduce model bias during training. During the first detection stage, the splitter generates unique rules that are built using the IG theory and splits the defects data into single-defect and mixed-defect patterns. Single-defect patterns are then classified by RGRN, whereas mixed-defect patterns are fed into the deep-structured ML model for further classification. This combination improves the ability of the proposed approach to classify diverse defect patterns and achieve a better overall performance. Our experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves an overall detection accuracy of 86.17% on a dataset that contains real data representing both single-defect and mixed-defect patterns, as commonly found in real manufacturing scenarios, outperforming existing ML-based models."

Vertically etched III-V semiconductor devices typically require sidewall passivation to suppress leakage currents and planarization of the passivation material for metal interconnection and device integration. It is, however, challenging to planarize all devices at once. This technique offers wafer-scale passivation and planarization that is automatically leveled to the device top in the 1-3-/spl mu/m vicinity surrounding each device. In this method, a dielectric hard mask is used to define the device area. An undercut structure is intentionally created below the hard mask, which is retained during the subsequent polymer spinning and anisotropic polymer etch back. The spin-on polymer that fills in the undercut seals the sidewalls for all the devices across the wafer. After the polymer etch back, the dielectric mask is removed leaving the polymer surrounding each device level with its device top to atomic scale flatness. This integration method is robust and is insensitive to spin-on polymer thickness, polymer etch nonuniformity, and device height difference. It prevents the polymer under the hard mask from etch-induced damage and creates a polymer-free device surface for metallization upon removal of the dielectric mask. We applied this integration technique in fabricating an InP-based photonic switch that consists of a mesa photodiode and a quantum-well waveguide modulator using benzocyclobutene (BCB) polymer. We demonstrated functional integrated photonic switches with high process yield of >90%, high breakdown voltage of >25 V, and low ohmic contact resistance of /spl sim/10 /spl Omega/. To the best of our knowledge, such an integration of a surface-normal photodiode and a lumped electroabsorption modulator with the use of BCB is the first to be implemented on a single substrate."

Subsequently, a schedule for a new problem with different production requirements, initial setup status, and number of setup change operators is obtained by sequentially retrieving and reusing the cases that are most similar to the states encountered during schedule generation in the reasoning step. Extensive experiments demonstrate the performances of the proposed approach, compared to those of dispatching rule and meta-heuristic methods, and also show the robustness against possible perturbations in terms of production requirements and initial setup status based on real world scale datasets. The proposed method significantly outperformed a meta-heuristic algorithm in terms of computation time while requiring much less sacrifice in a performance metric than the competitive dispatching rules."

The experimental results obtained by the IE-effect are presented. The trench IEGTs with 6- and 12-/spl mu/m trench depth were compared with a planar IEGT. These experimental results show that the trench IEGT has a better trade-off relation between saturation voltage and turn-off loss than the planar IEGT. Moreover, the trench IEGT with 12-/spl mu/m trench depth has a better trade-off relation than that with 6-/spl mu/m trench depth. These results prove clearly that the IE-effect improves the trade-off relation. Turn-off characteristics of parallel-connected 4.5 kV trench IEGTs are discussed. The influence of the gate circuit parameters on a turn-off current balance was examined in order to realize high turn-off current capability. It is concluded that the reduction of the gate parasitic inductance is important for uniform turn-off operation. At optimum gate circuit condition, it is shown that the maximum turn-off current increases in proportion to the number of IEGT chips. As a result, a 1300-A turn-off current capability was obtained using nine parallel-connected IEGT chips in an inductive load circuit and without any snubber circuits. In conclusion, the IEGT has a good prospect of replacing the gate turn-off thyristor (GTO) for high-voltage applications, such as motor controls for traction, industrial motor drives, and so on."

In the SMIT system, the stencil mask acts like a resist mask, and ions passing through the mask holes are implanted into selected regions of the Si substrate chip by chip. Use of SMIT has several advantages, notably lower manufacturing cost and shorter process time than in the case of conventional processing, because no photolithography process (including deposition and stripping of resist) is required. We have already demonstrated an application of SMIT to transistor fabrication, using various implanted dose conditions for the same wafer. Threshold voltage values can be controlled as effectively by implanted doses as they can by conventional implantation, and the dose dependence of the threshold voltage could be obtained from one wafer to which various implantation conditions are applied. Using SMIT, implantation conditions can be changed chip by chip without additional processes. This flexibility of implantation conditions is another advantage of SMIT.

Recently, conventional process monitoring-based principal component analysis (PCA) has been applied to semiconductor manufacturing by quickly detecting when the process abnormalities have occurred. However, the unique characteristics of the semiconductor processes, nonlinearity in most batch processes, multimodal batch trajectories due to multiple operating conditions, significantly limit the applicability of PCA to the fault detection of semiconductor manufacturing. To explicitly address these unique issues in semiconductor processes, a principal components (PCs)-based Gaussian mixture model (GMM) (named PCGMM) has been proposed in this paper. GMM is capable to handle complicated data with nonlinearity or multimodal features by a mixture of multiple Gaussian components, which is very suitable to describe observations from semiconductor processes. Furthermore, two quantification indexes (negative Log likelihood probability and Mahalanobis distance) are proposed for assessing process states, and a Bayesian inference-based calculation method is further used to provide the process failure probability. The validity and effectiveness of PCGMM-based fault detection model are illustrated through two simulation processes and a semiconductor manufacturing process.

The test samples are unpassivated Schottky-gate HEMTs and metal-insulator-semiconductor HEMTs (MIS-HEMTs) with SiN gate dielectric. For HEMTs, the dominant charge trapping sources are the surface trap states, whereas, for MIS-HEMTs, they are trap states in the SiN gate dielectric and GaN buffer. When these devices are shined with the UV light, the drain current increases apparently in both samples owing to the generated photocurrent. By combining the UV illumination and pulsed I-V measurement, we find out the UV light has less effect on the surface charge trapping in the unpassivated HEMTs. Moreover, in MIS-HEMTs, we observe the charge trapping in the SiN gate dielectric becomes more serious under UV illumination, whereas the charge trapping in the GaN buffer is suppressed significantly. These findings are important for designing a GaN-based HEMT for photonic applications. In addition, the different responses of the surface-, buffer-, and gate-dielectric-related charge trapping to the UV light suggest that it would be easier to distinguish the trap types by introducing the UV illumination during the pulse measurement."

The variable data collected from semiconductor manufacturing processes, in which hundreds of unit processes are implemented according to specific conditions and sequences, are interdependent, and the variables related to previous processes influence the variables in subsequent processes. Therefore, the order of processes should be considered when building a model that searches for the causes of low yield. However, there have been few studies in this area. This paper proposes a low-yield root cause search method considering the order of processes using a long short-term memory with attention mechanism (LSTM-AM) model. Specifically, the LSTM-AM model is applied to data classified according to the process structure of semiconductor products, and the causes of low yield are determined considering the order of processes by extracting attention weights. Experiments are conducted to verify the suitability of the proposed method using real yield data from a semiconductor company. The experimental results confirm that the proposed method outperforms the existing low yield root cause search methods in terms of low yield prediction."

Picosecond Dynamics of Semiconductor Fabry–PÉrot Lasers: A Simplified Model,"[""Weiguo Yang""]",IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Quantum Electronics,2007,7,0,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4346534/,"[""Lightwave System, Ciena Corporation, Linthicum, MD, USA""]","[""United States""]","A simplified semiconductor laser model that is sufficient to describe laser dynamics on a picosecond time scale is presented. The model prescribes a time-domain differential equation regarding the complex amplitude of the light field. The simplification comes from an approximation of the semiconductor optical gain dynamics that typically exhibits two distinct time scales with a slow component on the order of hundreds of picoseconds and a fast component on the order of a few picoseconds or subpicoseconds. For laser dynamics concerning mainly the picosecond time scale, the slow component of the material gain dynamics can be treated as a static effect and the fast component can be treated as instantaneous. Such treatment also shines light on relations between semiconductor optical amplifier nonlinearities such as self-phase modulation and device parameters such as the linewidth enhancement factor and confinement factors. The model correctly predicts various picosecond laser dynamics of semiconductor lasers including the preference of a constant-power, FM mode-locking operation once the correct chirp condition is first established. A coupled multispatial mode (MSM) model based on the simplified time-domain laser model is used to successfully explain self-start AM mode-locking operations of single-contact Fabry-Perot laser diodes (FP-LDs) that have been observed experimentally. A mechanism for establishing the needed condition for single-contact FP-LD's self-FM mode-locking operations is also proposed based on the understanding of the MSM AM mode-locking operations."

The BIR (building-in reliability) methodology, on the contrary, preserves the merits of fast response, early alarm and closed-loop control. For semiconductor manufacturing, the BIR system has two major components: WLR (wafer-level reliability) and the BIR database, which enable us to make use of prior information to reduce risk and time to market. A thorough introduction on BIR system is given in this paper. The use of the BIR database, which is common in the aerospace development, resembles the Bayes approach in statistics. The proposed WLR system includes 4 fundamental elements: WLR design, WLR assessment, WLR baseline and WLR control. Practical concerns, implementations, and examples are depicted on these elements to clarify the WLR applications to the IC (integrated circuit) industries. In Section V, the example 2 on EM test indicates the procedures on formulating the control schemes. Recent studies on WLR and the BIR database after 1994 are also reviewed and described.

The different dVg/dt event is performed by using fast sweep characterization with sweeping time (tsweep) varied from 10ms to25 μs. As the tsweep is decreased, i.e., high dVg/dt, p-GaN HEMTs show a negative VTH shift and a high measured gate current. The higher measured gate current is mainly due to the displacement current with respect to a high dVg/dt. To further understand the impacts of capacitance on VTH stability, p-GaN power HEMTs are connected with different additional capacitance (Cadditional) between gate-to-source terminals. The results indicate that the negative VTH shift and the gate current are highly correlated with the Cadditional, i.e., a large negative VTH shift and a high measured gate current in the device with a large Cadditional, suggesting that the charging capacitance caused by the displacement current during a high dVg/dt event can influence the VTHstability.

Pegging is a process of assigning wafer lots to orders for wafers. We consider two types of pegging strategies: hard pegging strategy, under which the lot-order assignment is not changed once lots are assigned to orders; and soft pegging strategy, under which the lot-order assignment can be changed during the production period. For the soft pegging strategy, we develop three operational policies and three algorithms for the pegging problem of assigning lots to orders with the objective of minimizing total tardiness of the orders. To evaluate performance of the suggested policies and algorithms, we perform simulation experiments using real factory data as well as randomly generated data sets. Results of the simulation tests show that the repegging policies and the algorithms operated under the soft pegging strategy give better results than the hard pegging strategy."

By varying the Mg x Zn 1-x O layer thickness (50-400 nm), we modulated the detection wavelength from lowpass to bandpass. For a thin (50 nm) Mg x Zn 1-x O film, most short-wavelength (less than 340 nm) incident photons-more than 69%-passed through the Mg x Zn 1-x O and were absorbed by ZnO, causing a higher photoresponse in the short-wavelength region and thus a low-pass PD. As the thickness of the Mg x Zn 1-x O film increased, the short-wavelength photoresponse was gradually suppressed, and a bandpass PD was achieved. A thicker (400 nm) Mg x Zn 1-x O film absorbed more short-wavelength (less than 340 nm) incident photons, leaving only 5.5% of the incident photons to be absorbed by the ZnO layer underneath. This reduced the short-wavelength photoresponse, yielding a bandpass PD with a detection wavelength of 325-360 nm. Although the short-wavelength (less than 340 nm) incident photons were absorbed by Mg x Zn 1-x O, few photogenerated electron-hole pairs contributed to the photoresponse; instead, they were trapped by the defects in Mg x Zn 1-x O because of its poor crystalline quality."

To realize the normally off operation of the MIS-HFETs, a 2-nm-thick SiN (as an insulator) and GaN-based nonpolar epitaxial layers that are free from polarization charges are employed. We have found that a thicker nonpolar AlN buffer layer achieves a GaN layer with a narrower full width at half maximum of the X-ray rocking curve and higher electron mobility. The fabricated MIS gate structure on the AlN buffer layer successfully decreases the gate leakage current and enables a more positive gate bias of up to +4 V, which is advantageous to achieve a higher drain current. Moreover, the n-GaN capping layer between gate and ohmic electrodes helps to reduce parasitic resistance and suppress current collapse. The fabricated a -plane MIS-HFET exhibits a threshold voltage of + 1.3 V with a high drain current of 112 mA/mm. The presented MIS-HFETs will be desirable in next-generation radio-frequency and power switching application fields."

The piezoelectric charges induced in the vicinity of the gate electrode are simulated by using a finite-element method. This simulation solves the piezoelectric equations with piezoelectric and elastic stiffness constants, assuming that stress is applied to the gate edges in the HFET. The detailed simulation reveals that the piezoelectric charge distribution does not depend on the gate direction, although a large amount of piezoelectric charges is induced in the vicinity of the gate edges, which is consistent with the experimental result.

The device is longitudinally divided into M sections and a rate equation for averaged photon and carrier densities is used for each section. We demonstrate that the accuracy on the calculated noise figure strictly depends on the number of sections M. We obtain a good tradeoff between the results accuracy and the computational complexity with M=8. The model is then applied to study the noise in a distributed Bragg reflector (DBR)-type gain-clamped SOA for varying signal power, pump current, and lasing wavelength. We show that changes in the spatial carrier profile caused by the input signal significantly affect the noise figure, even when the gain is constant. A slight dependence of the noise figure on lasing wavelength is also foreseen, while the dependence on the pump current is negligible. A new method for gain-clamped SOA noise figure reduction is proposed, based on unbalanced Bragg reflectors. An improvement of noise figure (NF) as large as 2 dB is devised."

Here, we design the tunable alloying Sb–S–Se nanowires (NWs), which can be used in the research field of polarization-sensitive photodetectors because of their low symmetry crystal structure, suitable bandgap, and high mobility.

By investigating the polarization characteristics of the photodetector, the dichroic ratio of the photodetector can reach 3.8 at 532 nm. By regulating the proportion of each component in the alloy semiconductor, an effective method is provided for adjusting the photoresponse spectrum and optimizing the performance of the polarization-sensitive photodetector, which has a promising research prospect in the future."

The amplification of the 4-ns pulse was linear and had a maximum gain of 23.3 dB at an introduced pump density of 1.4 W/μm 2 in a straight waveguide. The gain was more efficient than with the 80-ps pulse, which was limited by the optical damage threshold of the input antireflective coating (1.6 W/μm 2 ). These high-gain operations should enable semiconductor Raman amplifiers to be used for detecting signals from chemical or biological materials, in addition to infrared light frequency selective amplification with wavelength-division multiplexing in optical communications."

Due to this reason, many authors suggest the use of graphite crucibles or of carbon coated quartz crucibles. In order to avoid the contact between the growing crystal and the crucible, it was proposed to opportunely control the wetting angle. However, it was shown that this is possible only under microgravity conditions or by imposing a pressure difference between the melt and the solidifying crystal. In this work, we show that it is possible to avoid the contact between the crystal and the crucible by interposing a thin liquid boron oxide layer. This condition can be obtained in a vertical Bridgman furnace by covering the polycrystalline charge with a boron oxide pellet.

Trapezoidal and triangular waveforms are considered in endurance cycling tests. For endurance cycling with the trapezoidal waveforms, different rising time (T r )/falling time (T f ), e.g., 0.05–5μs, with a fixed pulse width (T width ) and different pulse width (T width ), i.e., 0-10μs, with fixed rising time (T r )/falling time (T f ) are used. As for the endurance cycling with the triangular waveforms, the frequencies are ranged from 1 kHz to 1 MHz. The results indicate that a shorter rising time (T r )/falling time (T f ) results in a completely different endurance characteristic, and a longer T width leads to an earlier breakdown. Furthermore, the higher frequency of the triangular waveform results in a larger remnant polarization (2Pr) after endurance cycling. Overall, the endurance is highly dependent on the pulsing schemes, suggesting that a standardized methodology for the endurance evaluation is necessary for fair benchmarks and qualification of the ferroelectric-based technologies."

In order to optimize the trade-off between BV and Specific On-Resistance (RON,SP), the SIPOS field plate is applied on Si/SiC LDMOS for the first time in this paper.

The identification of key factors (called CT-related) can not only improve the prediction performance but also facilitate the control of CT, which is of particular significance. This paper focuses on gathering subtle variables into the candidate variables set along with the further analysis which is required in the correlation analysis between various candidate factors and CTs of wafer lots. The candidates set is first constructed to collect all factors that may affect wafer lots' CT. Then, a regression-based model is proposed to select CT-related variables, which consists of three parts: 1) discretization; 2) adaptive logistic regression-based correlation analysis; and 3) CT-related factor selection. Subsequently, a parallel computation model is implemented to forecast the CTs of wafer lots.

Its concentration is highly dependent upon high temperature annealing. To study the effect of high temperature annealing on the properties of HPSI 4H-SiC, vertical-type photoconductive semiconductor switches were fabricated on two types of substrates, where one was non-annealed (nPCSS) and the other was annealed at 1500°C for 15 min (aPCSS). A 532-nm pulsed laser was utilized to excite the PCSSs from the side facet. The high temperature annealing reduced the Z 1/2 defect concentration in the aPCSS, which led to fewer photo-generated carriers in the aPCSS compared with nPCSS. The optoelectronic properties of the aPCSS exhibited much stronger dependence on the excitation optical energy and bias voltage than those of the nPCSS. The falling time in the aPCSS increases as the optical energy goes higher than 2 mJ. At the constant optical excitation energy of 2 mJ, the falling time in the aPCSS increases as the bias voltage increases, whereas that in the nPCSS stays almost constant."

These effects are responsible for the magnetic-field dependence of electrical resistivity. Namely, the application of the external magnetic field suppresses the thermodynamic spin fluctuations, thus promoting negative magnetoresistance (MR). Simultaneously, scattering by built-in spatial fluctuations of the atomic spins increases with the magnetic field. The latter effect is due to the growth of the magnitude of random local Zeeman splittings with the magnetic field. It promotes positive MR.

With CMP being one of the main water consumers and producers of wastewater in the fab, more low energy/cost effective methods are being developed to avoid a future risk of violating discharge regulations for copper-containing wastewater. In addition, with the expected increase in water consumption, there is an incentive to find better ways to treat and recycle wastewaters. The possibility of using biological organisms to treat copper and organic-containing wastewater is studied. Two different approaches are combined to create a treatment strategy: adsorption on immobilized cells to treat copper and biodegradation by immobilized cells to treat organics [specifically isopropyl alcohol (IPA)]. Two previously developed bacterial systems are used. In addition, predictive models for the two cases developed in previous work are evaluated in this combined treatment. Continuous flow experiments were performed. Copper adsorbed to the immobilized cells and the binding capacity is comparable to other systems found in the literature. The IPA was totally degraded."

Because of the feed back from the DBR section, the modulation bandwidth of the lasers is over 25 GHz, which is notably larger than the 19 GHz for a normal single section DFB laser. The reflector of the devices has the same multi-quantum wells (MQWs) as the DFB section, which simplifies the device fabrication greatly, helping to lower the device cost. For the DBR integrated DFB lasers, experimental results show that a larger modulation current efficiency can be obtained when the DFB wavelength is more positively detuned relative to the reflection peak of the DBR reflector. This indicates that a static detune between the DFB wavelength and the DBR reflection peak can be introduced into a distributed reflector laser to get a good detune condition, helping to lower the device cost of high speed directly modulated lasers."

When using tunable single mode lasers as input signals, the generated FWM mode comb is tunable in the mode spacing and the wavelength. As a result in time domain, widely tunable pulses in the repetition rate and the carrier frequency are obtained. Since the phase signature of the FWM modes is not linear over the whole mode comb, different filtering techniques can be applied for filtering modes with linear phase in order to efficiently generate short pulses. With the optimal filtering technique, pulses with full width at half maximum of less than 2 ps and a pulse repetition rate of 20 GHz can be obtained."

The net effect of nonuniform charge carrier generation as a result of waveguide-like mode formation is theoretically assessed, and the additional areas of investigation into this pivotal problem area in the PCSS design are suggested."

While most of the temperature drop will be compensated by feedforward control, feedback provided by MMPC will cope with the errors due to warped wafers. This result is important for the semiconductor wafer baking process, because temperature nonuniformity will affect critical dimension of the wafer."

In pursuing power conversion efficiency, power module’s high-speed and high-power operation leads to electromagnetic (EM) noise in a very wide frequency range, potentially interfering with nearby wireless communications [e.g., long-term evolution (LTE)]. This letter analyzes the source of EM noise from the power modules using GaN transistors in half-bridge circuits. EM noise was clearly observed in the proximity of power modules and attributed to two primary sources in the frequency range of interest up to 6 GHz: 1) the periodical switching operation of GaN transistors in the output stage and 2) the logic operation of complementary metal–oxide–semiconductor digital circuits to control gate drivers, in the lower and upper side of frequencies, respectively. Measurements analyzed the EM noise characteristics at different probing locations over the assembly of two GaN power modules as well as in different operating conditions by strategically supplying source signals. The influence of EM noise on LTE receiver performance is evaluated with wireless system-level simulation and related to the degradation of its minimum receivable input power."

Second, a permutation feature importance (PFI) for the full set of features for each operation is computed and the performance is statistically evaluated. The optimal subset of features is then chosen by a sequential backward search based on the PFI values. Third, the performance in terms of the coefficient of determination of each optimized model is evaluated by means of the initial performance.

From 25 to 300 °C, the safety limit of positive V gs of SiC MOSFETs is mainly dependent on the gate oxide on the JFET surface, whereas that of negative V gs is dependent on the gate oxide on the channel surface. The gate oxide on the channel surface is weaker than that on the JFET surface in terms of Fowler–Nordheim (F-N) tunneling, resulting in asymmetric safety V gs of current SiC MOSFET. Moreover, when temperature ranges from 25 to 150 °C, the degradation of gate oxide under −15 V <  V gs  < 25 V is caused by the hole or electron direct tunneling mechanism. However, when the temperature reaches 300 °C, the degradation of gate oxide under −5 V <  V gs  < 10 V is caused by the hole or electron hopping conduction mechanism. Furthermore, the reliability of gate oxide is evaluated by the time-dependent dielectric breakdown measurement. The charge-to-breakdown ( Q BD ) of gate oxide is severely degraded at 300 °C mainly due to the barrier height (ΦB) degradation.

Only a few key parameters, primarily the dielectric constant and the resulting device capacitance, have been regarded to be of central importance. Many insulating layers are however not simple dielectrics, an example are space charge gate electrets with internally trapped charges. Space charge gate electrets affect the electrical characteristics of diodes and transistors in a much more sophisticated manner, they are for example the key element in flash memories. We present impedance measurements of an organic metal-insulator-semiconductor (MIS) diode and corresponding measurements of a related organic field effect transistor. Both devices have a comparable design, with polyvinylalcohol as gate electret and the methanofullerene PCBM as organic semiconductor. Pronounced electret effects of charge injection and trapping are observed by impedance measurements of the MIS structure and these effects are found equally expressed in the electrical characteristics of the OFET configuration, reflecting first steps towards organic flash memories"

The MOS detectors exhibited leakage currents two orders of magnitude lower than that observed in a Schottky barrier detector (SBD) fabricated on similar 4H-SiC epilayers. The MOS detectors exhibited a much higher energy resolution of 0.4% compared to 0.8% observed in an SBD for 5486-keV alpha particles although both the devices showed a high charge collection efficiency (CCE) of 96% when exposed to the alpha particles. Capacitance mode deep-level transient spectroscopy (C-DLTS) revealed the presence of “lifetime killer”Z1/2defects in similar concentrations in both the devices, and however, the corresponding capture cross section in the SBD has been observed to be one order of magnitude higher compared to the MOS detector, and instead of EH 6/7 center seen in the SBD, the MOS device showed the presence of EH 5 center. The higher resolution of the MOS device is attributed to the lower leakage current and difference in defect configurations observed between the two devices. The MOS detector showed a positive polarity C-DLTS peak with an activation energy of 1.22 eV, which is likely due to the nonnegligible impedance of the back contact because of the SiO 2 layer.

The results clearly demonstrate that both the SiO 2 and Si 3 N 4 films grown at these low temperatures (400?C) exhibited comparable growth rates to those of films thermally grown by conventional techniques at elevated temperatures (800?C-1000?C). Data is presented of Silicon Oxide (SiO 2 ) films grown with various inert gases (He, Ar, Kr, Xe), mixed with O 2 . Silicon Nitride (Si 3 N 4 ) films were grown by using Ar/N 2 , Ar/N 2 /H 2 , and Ar/NH 3 gas mixtures. Both film types were grown in a vacuum chamber using different ...(Show More)"

This framework is able to predict FT yield at wafer fabrication stage, so that FT low yield problems can be caught at an earlier production stage compared to past studies. Our work presents a robust solution to automatically handle both numerical and categorical production related data without prior knowledge of the low yield root cause. Gaussian Mixture Models, One Hot Encoder and Label Encoder techniques are adopted for data pre-processing.

In combination with resistor-capacitor network impulse response theory, the transient temperature rise curve is processed using the Bayesian iterative deconvolution method. By extracting the thermal time constant, nondestructive characterization of the temperature increase and thermal resistance characteristics of each material layer in the heat flow path is achieved, and the complementary relationship between the temperature change in the active region during heating and the device heat dissipation characteristics is verified.

To further improve device characteristics, heterogeneous integration of III-V compound semiconductors that provide optical gain, a high modulation efficiency, and optical non-linearity is desired. This paper describes the heterogeneous integration of membrane III-V compound semiconductor photonic devices that have a similar structure including thickness and refractive index. These devices provide efficient optical coupling with a Si waveguide using a simple taper waveguide structure. If the total thickness of the film structure is designed to be less than the critical thickness (calculated to be 430 nm for fabrication conditions such as bonding and growth temperatures), high-quality epitaxial layers can be grown on a thin InP layer directly bonded to the Si substrate. Therefore, regrowth techniques are employed on bonded InP layer on SiO 2 /Si substrate. We fabricate two kinds of laser-integrated Mach-Zehnder modulators using epitaxial regrowth on Si substrates. One uses Si phase modulators, and the other uses InP-based modulators. A micro-transfer-printing technology is also important when the number of III-V devices is relatively small. Furthermore, the micro-transfer-printing technology enables devices to be selected that meet the required characteristics before integration. For this purpose, we try to integrate a membrane laser on a Si substrate, in which the membrane laser is fabricated on InP substrate. The device shows a threshold current of 0.8 mA when the active region length is 140 μm.

So, we developed a new idea, to provide a more robust and selective injection mechanism. This is done by a Zener tunnel diode for electron injection combined with a pin diode for hole injection, the Germanium Zener-Emitter. This tunnel process is extremely fast and highly selective towards the direct conduction band. For the first time, we present here a full comprehensive study.Data transfer across millimeter-scale electrical wires is limited by both data rates and power density, which creates a performance bottleneck for semiconductor microchips in modern computer systems. Hence, silicon based platforms for optical communication are diligently explored for an on-chip optical data transfer. Semiconductor optical amplifiers provide signal recovery and loss compensation in advanced photonic circuits and are, thus, indispensable components for such platforms. However, silicon photonic components have to operate at much lower voltages and energy-per-bit metrics before it is worth integrating them on-chip with a CPU. The usage of tunnel junctions to control carrier injection can provide a fast and energy-saving alternative. Here, we present experimental results on direct conduction band carrier modulation in the indirect semiconductor Ge by Zener tunnel injection. Electrons are injected by a reverse-biased p-n Zener tunnel diode and recombine radiatively with holes injected by a forward biased p-i-n diode. This injection mechanism favors tunneling of electrons into the direct conduction band valley with concomitant improvements of optoelectronic properties. Benchmarking the performance, 2.42 dB transmission change at 0.9 V bias (1660 nm) at 300 K confirm the working principle. Our device can serve as a starting point to investigate the benefits of tunnel injection for silicon photonic devices."

The failure mechanisms of these two cases are analyzed and summarized as follows: The failure of high-power GaAs PCSS is mainly dominated by the development of current filaments under low output currents. A large number of energetic carriers in the bulk region of the current filament can cause the dot damage. When the dot damage is dense enough to form a continuous chain connecting the PCSS electrodes, a damage path is created and a catastrophic breakdown occurs. The thermal stress is the main cause of the failure of high-power GaAs PCSS under high current scenarios. The stress can cause local microscopic fracture on the surface of PCSS. At the time when these local microscopic fractures reach a critical level, a macroscopic fracture occurs resulting in a disintegration of the high-power PCSS."

Enhanced Electrical and Thermal Properties of Trench Metal–Oxide–Semiconductor Field-Effect Transistor Built on Copper Substrate,"[""Qi Wang"", ""Ihsiu Ho"", ""Minhua Li""]",IEEE Electron Device Letters,2009,8,7,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4721602/,"[""Fairchild Semiconductor Corporation, West Jordan, UT, USA""]","[""United States""]","Vertical metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistors (UMOSFETs) were built on silicon substrates thinned to 7 mum and plated with 50- mum copper as drain electrode and mechanical support. Compared to the same devices on silicon substrates of 200 mum thick, the UMOSFET on 7-mum silicon demonstrates at least 16% less channel resistance and two times better device ruggedness. The reduced resistance is due to enhanced carrier mobility caused by increasing biaxial compressive thermal stress in silicon perpendicular to the channel, which is confirmed by a 3-D piezoresistance model. The doubling of ruggedness is attributed to a much improved transient thermal conductance."

Color Converted White Light-Emitting Diodes With 637.6 MHz Modulation Bandwidth,"[""Haicheng Cao"", ""Shan Lin"", ""Zhanhong Ma"", ""Xiaodong Li"", ""Jing Li"", ""Lixia Zhao""]",IEEE Electron Device Letters,2019,39,0,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8561140/,"[""Semiconductor lighting Research and Development Center, Institute of Semiconductors, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China""]","[""China""]","High bandwidth GaN-based white light-emitting diode (LED) was fabricated using GHz bandwidth blue LED chip combined with CdSe/ZnS semiconductor quantum dots (QDs). The maximum optical power of the blue LED chip can reach 7.2 mW. By changing the optical power ratio of the LED chip to the white LED, we have investigated the modulation properties and established a frequency response function of QD-converted white LED. The behaviors of the measured and simulated bandwidths using the function are in good agreement with each other. After optimizing the optical power ratio and decreasing the chip carrier lifetime, the 637.6 MHz bandwidth of QD-converted white LED was achieved, which can support 675 Mb/s real-time non-return-to-zero on-off-keying signal at a low bit error rate of 4.35 × 10 -8 without optical filters. Our findings can help to design high bandwidth white LEDs for visible light communication applications in free space."
General Method for Calculating the Response and Noise Spectra of Active Fabry–Perot Semiconductor Waveguides With External Optical Injection,"[""S\u00d8ren Blaaberg"", ""Jesper Mork""]",IEEE Journal of Quantum Electronics,2009,3,0,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5153576/,"[""DTU Fotonik, Department of Photonics Engineering, Technical University of Denmark, Kongens Lyngby, Denmark""]","[""Denmark""]",We present a theoretical method for calculating small-signal modulation responses and noise spectra of active Fabry-Perot semiconductor waveguides with external light injection. Small-signal responses due to either a modulation of the pump current or due to an optical amplitude or phase modulation of the input field can be calculated. Both responses and noise spectra are given through semianalytical expressions taking into account the longitudinal extent and finite end-facet reflectivities of the active device. Different examples of responses and spectra are presented for semiconductor optical amplifiers and an injection-locked laser. We also demonstrate the applicability of the method to analyze slow and fast light effects in semiconductor waveguides. Finite reflectivities of the facets are found to influence the phase changes of the injected microwave-modulated light.
Electronic Noise in Semiconductor-Based Radiation Detection Systems: A Comprehensive Analysis With a Unified Approach,"[""Giuseppe Bertuccio"", ""Filippo Mele""]",IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science,2023,0,0,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10236974/,"[""Department of Electronics, Information and Bioengineering, Politecnico di Milano, Como, Italy""]","[""Italy""]","The electronic noise is a key-issue during the phases of design, integration, and characterization of a detection system for ionizing radiation, as it determines both its ultimate and actual performances. The precise identification and quantification of all noise sources and associated components allow to implement specific strategies for their control and minimization during the system design and manufacturing phases, to disentangle all noise contributions, and to verify their correspondence with the expectations during the system characterization. An effective approach to the electronic noise problem requires to consider in detail all the parts of the detection system but it is not so rare to still observe that the electronic noise is erroneously confused or interpreted as the noise of the electronics or as the quadratic sum of the electronics’ and detector’s noise, usually reducing the latter to that one associated with its dark current only. In this article, a detailed analysis of the noise model of a radiation detection system employing a semiconductor detector is presented using a unified approach which takes into account all sources and causes of electronic noise and their reciprocal interaction. The noise related to the generation, transport, and loss of the signal charge in the detector is analyzed in detail and, in particular, the charge trapping and detrapping processes, showing how their contributions could be not negligible even in detectors based on high purity semiconductors. The unified approach allows to disclose the interplay between the detector, the interconnection, and the front-end electronics (FEEs) showing that some noise contributions cannot be attributed exclusively to a single part, but it is correct to refer to them as system noises. Several examples taken from experimental data are presented and discussed and a method to determine the dielectric noise introduced by the interconnection and the detector is described.

To achieve a high breakdown voltage, a novel lateral drift region OFET(LDR-OFET) is proposed in this letter. By employing the diketopyrrolopyrrole-based polymer(DPPT-TT) and Poly (methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) to form semiconductor and insulator layers respectively, the fabricated LDR-OFET, despite the simple process and low cost, exhibits an excellent off-state breakdown capability while maintaining a considerable on-state performance. With a20 μmlength of the drift region, the LDR-OFET realizes 2200V breakdown voltage on a spin-coated 50nm thick semiconductor layer. The average electric field of the proposed device reaches 1.18MV/cm before an avalanche-like breakdown occurs. The physical nature of the breakdown mechanism is explored using the 1-D PIN equivalent structure and avalanche breakdown theory. The correctness and effectiveness of the proposed LDR-OFET and breakdown analysis are well demonstrated and validated by experimental results. The LDR-OFETs are expected to fill the blank of organic power devices and be the core component of future organic power integrated circuits."
A Convolutional Neural Network for Fault Classification and Diagnosis in Semiconductor Manufacturing Processes,"[""Ki Bum Lee"", ""Sejune Cheon"", ""Chang Ouk Kim""]",IEEE Transactions on Semiconductor Manufacturing,2017,321,0,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7867863/,"[""Department of Industrial Engineering, Yonsei University, Seoul, South Korea""]","[""South Korea""]","Many studies on the prediction of manufacturing results using sensor signals have been conducted in the field of fault detection and classification (FDC) for semiconductor manufacturing processes. However, fault diagnosis used to find clues as to root causes remains a challenging area. In particular, process monitoring using neural networks has been employed to only a limited extent because it is a black box model, making the relationships between input data and output results difficult to interpret in actual manufacturing settings, despite its high classification performance. In this paper, we propose a convolutional neural network (CNN) model, named FDC-CNN, in which a receptive field tailored to multivariate sensor signals slides along the time axis, to extract fault features. This approach enables the association of the output of the first convolutional layer with the structural meaning of the raw data, making it possible to locate the variable and time information that represents process faults. In an experiment on a chemical vapor deposition process, the proposed method outperformed other deep learning models."
Dynamical Characteristics of a Dual-Beam Optically Injected Semiconductor Laser,"[""Yi-Huan Liao"", ""Jia-Ming Liu"", ""Fan-Yi Lin""]",IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Quantum Electronics,2013,15,0,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6395800/,"[""Department of Electrical Engineering, University of California, Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA, USA"", ""Department of Electrical Engineering, Institute of Photonics Technologies, National Tsinghua University, Hsinchu, Taiwan""]","[""Taiwan"", ""United States""]","Dual-beam optically injected semiconductor lasers have been utilized in the field of microwave photonics for generations of microwave signals. To better understand the nonlinear behavior of a dual-beam optically injected semiconductor laser, we experimentally investigate the dynamics scenarios and their transition routes. By injecting a slave laser with beams from two master lasers, mappings of the dynamics scenarios including PP, PS, SP, SS, S' S', S' L, LS', and LL are plotted under different injection strengths and detuning frequencies. These scenarios are defined and differentiated by whether the dynamics and the characteristic frequencies originated from the single-beam injection scheme are being preserved ( P ), shifted ( S ), or suppressed ( S ' ) after both beams are simultaneously injected. The letter L is used if the slave laser is already injection-locked by one of the beams under the single-beam injection condition. The transition routes among these dynamics scenarios are shown to be clearly traceable by tracking and comparing the oscillation frequencies of the slave laser under the dual-beam and single-beam injections. Moreover, frequency-locking states are observed experimentally the first time in a dual-beam optically injected semiconductor laser, which occur when the frequency pushing effects from the two injected beams with opposite detunings balance each other off."
