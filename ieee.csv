In this concept, owing to the precise matching of positive and negative polarizations of both sides of GaN and AlGaN materials, average charge concentration in the material becomes nearly zero under reverse bias condition, which realizes extremely high breakdown voltage. This model is confirmed by device simulation taking all polarization charges of GaN-based materials into account. Furthermore, experimentally fabricated GaN-based Schottky barrier diodes showed a linear increase of breakdown voltage along the anode-cathode spacing, achieving a record breakdown voltage over 9000 V."

The single-phase (Ga, Cr)As film with the Curie temperature of 10 K is synthesized at growth temperature T s = 250degC and with nominal Cr content x = 0.016 . However, for the films with x > 0.02, the aggregation of Cr atoms is strongly enhanced as both T s and x increase, which not only brings strong compressive strain in the epilayer, but also roughens the surface. The origin of room-temperature ferromagnetism in (Ga, Cr)As films with nanoclusters is also discussed."

The analysis shows that the 2-D SMM is required to accurately account for the measured results. Using the 2-D SMM simulation, we find that there is almost no reflection at the interface from slot to waveguide while a large reflection exists at the interface from waveguide to slot, and the power loss is much larger than the power reflected. For a single slot, the slot width has little influence on the slot reflectivity, which coincides with the measured results. The reflection and transmission of the slot are found to be exponentially dependent on the slot depth"
Slotted Single Mode Lasers Integrated With a Semiconductor Optical Amplifier,"['Qiaoyin Lu', 'Azat Abdullaev', 'Marta Nawrocka', 'Wei-Hua Guo', ""James O'Callaghan"", 'John F. Donegan']",IEEE Photonics Technology Letters,2013,14,0,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6451120/,"{'Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of California Santa Barbara, Santa Barbara, CA, USA', 'Tyndall National Institute, Cork, Ireland', 'Semiconductor Photonics Group, Trinity College Dublin, Ireland'}","{'USA', 'Ireland'}","Performance of single mode lasers based on slots integrated with a semiconductor optical amplifier (SOA) is presented. To improve the laser performance, the anti-reflection and high-reflection coating films are applied to the front and back facets of the integrated device. The fabricated device demonstrates a threshold current of ~19 mA with the SOA left floating. Stable single mode performance is observed with a side mode suppression ratio > 50 dB at twice the threshold current. The output power of higher than 45 mW is achieved for the integrated device."
Determination of Internal Loss and Quasi-Fermi Level Separation From the Amplified Spontaneous Emission Spectrum of Fabry–PÉrot Semiconductor Lasers,"['W.H. Guo', 'D. Byrne', 'Q.Y. Lu', 'R.

Highly accurate quasi-Fermi level separation and internal loss are then derived by a minimum search process from the relationship between the spontaneous emission and gain
